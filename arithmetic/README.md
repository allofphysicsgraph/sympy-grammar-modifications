# objective

Starting with zero domain knowledge, programmatically introduce new information into the grammar while trying to keep human interaction to a minimum and maintain a readable grammar.

# outline

The file  
arithmetic_dataset.txt  
contains a bunch of simple valid expressions

The script  
generate_rules.py  
reads the arithmetic_dataset.txt

TRIE_OUTPUT is a DFA via a trie data structure on the grammar

Somehow (?) a grammar file  
Arithmetic.g4  
is produced
